This is the 2013 edition of:

cnfdd.c - delta debugger for CNFs in DIMACS format
cnfuzz.c - fuzzer for CNFs in DIMACS format

They both should be 64-bit clean, support QDIMACS, and option
fuzzing respectively delta debugging (see also our TAP'13 paper).

There was no change to:

mtcnfdd.c - multithreaded version (needs -pthread to compile)

See our SAT'2010 papers for more details and COPYING for the license.

Added an incremental fuzzer in cnfuzz_incr.c, based on cnfuzz.c

It creates files in the following modified DIMACS format -- each line is either: 
- a clause in the standard DIMACS format of the form "l1 l2 ... ln 0", or
- a SAT query in the following format "s l1 l2 ... ln 0", where s is a reserved character and l1 ... ln are the assumptions for the current query

Run make_fuzzers.csh to make both the original and the incremental fuzzer.
